        "text": "NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING FOR CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF THE SITE TREATMENT PLAN (STP) ANNUAL UPDATE FOR MIXED WASTE ON THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OAK RIDGE RESERVATION The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) Division of Solid Waste (DSWM) and Division of Remediation -- Oak Ridge (DoR-OR) have conditionally approved The Department of Energy's (DOE) Annual Update to the Oak Ridge Site Treatment Plan (STP) for developing treatment capacities and technologies across the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR). The Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management (OREM) is located at 200 Administration Road Oak Ridge, TN 37831. TDEC invites the public to submit comments on the conditionally approved revisions during a 60-day comment period ending on Thursday, August 15, 2024. The STP delineates how DOE will treat the site's mixed wastes or develop/modify technologies when necessary to address generated and stored mixed waste at the site, under Section 3021(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended in the Federal Facility Compliance Act (FFCA). DOE and TDEC are parties to this agreement. A notice of availability of the revised STP was published in The Roane County News and The Courier News on July 10, 2024, for public review and comment. A public hearing has been requested and is scheduled for August 8, 2024, at the Division of Remediation, Oak Ridge Office. Information regarding public hearing details is included in this public notice. Following the receipt of the Annual Update, Version 28.0, of the Site Treatment Plan (STP) and the Semiannual Progress Report, TDEC has concluded under STP Section 2.5.1 that the proposed changes to the overall schedules and technology development approach not previously included in this STP constitute an STP revision. Specifically, DOE has proposed to extend a target for providing a preliminary (60%) design for the sludge processing facility by six (6) years to allow for evaluation of current technologies and technology maturation availabilities, as well as other treatment methods to ensure OREM is pursuing the best available means and methods to deal with the stored sludge volumes safely and effectively. This review process included an extension of the review period for thirty (30) working days, with additional extensions agreed upon to facilitate the incorporation of necessary changes to the mixed Transuranic (TRU) Sludge milestones. As stipulated in Section 2.5.2.1 of the STP, conditional approval of revisions to the STP is based on the determination that the revisions are acceptable, subject to the results of public comment and consultation with affected states and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In line with this, and following our review, TDEC has conditionally approved the Annual Update to the STP, specifically concerning the revised mixed TRU Sludge milestones. These revisions are crucial for aligning with shared objectives and regulatory requirements, ensuring the safety and efficiency of mixed waste treatment processes on the ORR. To fulfill the requirements of Section 2.5.2.2, of the STP, TDEC is publishing this notice of availability of the revised STP for public review and comment. Additionally, the revised STP will be made available to affected states and the EPA for consideration and consultation. Final approval of these revisions will be determined within six months after TDEC's receipt of the proposed revision, under the stipulated review process. Furthermore, consistent with Section 2.5.3 of the STP, TDEC will engage in consultation with affected states and the EPA and seek public comments on the conditionally approved revisions. This is to ensure that all stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute to the decision-making process, enhancing transparency and collaboration in the management of mixed waste on the ORR. Following Section 2.8.5.2 of the STP, it is acknowledged that any milestones or target dates that are dependent upon the results of this deliverable review may be subject to adjustment. The DOE will provide written notification to TDEC of any necessary amendments to enforceable milestones or revisions to target dates, ensuring compliance with the conditions of approval. A public hearing will be held on Thursday, August 8, 2024, at the Division of Remediation, Oak Ridge Office located at 761 Emory Valley Road, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 as well as via video teleconference. Information on how to join online is provided below. An information session will be held from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., EDT for the public to inspect the STP with representatives of DOE and TDEC. The formal hearing will begin at 6:00 p.m., EDT with a presentation from TDEC on the conditionally approved revisions followed by a presentation by DOE describing the activities to treat the Site's mixed wastes or develop/modify technologies when necessary to address generated and stored mixed waste at the Site. After the presentations, TDEC will receive oral comments on STP from the public that will be recorded. The public may submit written comments at the meeting. Those who wish to join the public hearing virtually can do so by using the following link: tn.gov/environment/notices/doe-stp/hearing.

Regen was appointed successor trustee under the Deed of Trust (the Successor Trustee); and WHEREAS, default has occurred in the payment of the Note and other provisions of the Deed of Trust have been violated, and First Federal Bank, the owner and holder of the Note, has declared the entire indebtedness due and payable, and has directed the Successor Trustee to foreclose the Deed of Trust in accordance with the terms thereof; THE PUBLIC IS HEREBY NOTIFIED that the Successor Trustee will sell the Property at public auction to the highest and best bidder for cash at the front door of the Dickson County Justice Center, 500 Spring Street, Charlotte, Tennessee, at the hour of 3:00 p.m. prevailing central time on Friday, August 9, 2024, in bar of the Grantors right and equity of redemption, and subject, inter alia, to all liens, encumbrances, and other defects in title having priority or preference over the Deed of Trust, including any lien for unpaid real property taxes; to the rights of tenants in possession, if any; and to all applicable and enforceable laws of governmental authorities having jurisdiction of the Property, whether or not such matters are disclosed by the public records of the county wherein the Property is located. The Property is described in the Deed of Trust as follows: Land in Dickson County, Tennessee, being Lot No. 2, on the Plan of Final Plat of the Lewis Property Subdivision, of record in Plat Cabinet J, Slide 127, Registers Office for Dickson County, to which plan reference is hereby made for a more complete description.

The address of the Property is believed to be 1445 Rock Church Road, Dickson, Tennessee, but such address is not part of the legal description by which the Property will be sold, and in the event of a discrepancy between the legal description and the street address, the legal description will control. The Property is believed to be identified as Map 094-00-005.23 on the Dickson County tax map.The Property is believed to be improved. The right is reserved to adjourn the sale of the Property to another time and place without further publication upon announcement of such adjournment at the time and place set for the sale above; to adjourn the sale of the Property to another time and place without further publication upon announcement of such adjournment at the time and place set for the adjourned sale; and to repeat this process from time to time until the Property is sold by the Successor Trustee, or until the expiration of one (1) year following the originally scheduled date of sale, whichever occurs first. The right is reserved to cancel the sale of the Property at the request of the secured creditor, and to re-advertise the Property for sale at a later date, without diminishing, impairing, or otherwise affecting the priority of the Deed of Trust as a lien on the Property. If the highest bidder does not pay the bid price within twenty-four (24) hours of the sale, the right is reserved to sell the Property to the next highest bidder who is ready, willing, and able to purchase the Property for cash.

The Successor Trustee is unaware of any other party whose rights will be adversely affected by the sale of the Property pursuant to this notice except any heir or devisee of Kenneth S. Lewis, deceased. Upon information and belief, Kenneth S. Lewis is survived by a son, whose name is believed to be Kevin Lewis, but the Successor Trustee has no knowledge whether, and consequently no assurance is offered that, the said Kevin Lewis is in fact an heir or devisee of Kenneth S. Lewis, or whether Kevin Lewis is the only heir or devisee of Kenneth S. Lewis. The Successor Trustee is considered a debt collector within the meaning of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

The proposed project(s) is located at International Dr in Clarkrange, Fentress County, Tennessee. According to The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service it was clear that wetland features (coded as R5UBH and R4SBC) are present.R4SBC - RiverineSystem Riverine (R): The Riverine System includes all wetlands and deep-water habitats contained within a channel, with two exceptions: (1) wetlands dominated by trees, shrubs, persistent emergents, emergent mosses, or lichens, and (2) habitats with water containing ocean-derived salts of 0.5 ppt or greater. A channel is an open conduit either naturally or artificially created which periodically or continuously contains moving water, or which forms a connecting link between two bodies of standing water.Subsystem Intermittent (4): This Subsystem includes channels that contain flowing water only part of the year. When the water is not flowing, it may remain in isolated pools or surface water may be absent.Class Streambed (SB): Includes all wetlands contained within the Intermittent Subsystem of the Riverine System and all channels of the Estuarine System or of the Tidal Subsystem of the Riverine System that are completely dewatered at low tide.Water Regime Seasonally Flooded (C): Surface water is present for extended periods especially early in the growing season but is absent by the end of the growing season in most years. The water table after flooding ceases is variable, extending from saturated to the surface to a water table well below the ground surface.R5UBH - RiverineSystem Riverine (R): The Riverine System includes all wetlands and deep water habitats contained within a channel, with two exceptions: (1) wetlands dominated by trees, shrubs, persistent emergents, emergent mosses, or lichens, and (2) habitats with water containing ocean-derived salts of 0.5 ppt or greater. A channel is an open conduit either naturally or artificially created which periodically or continuously contains moving water, or which forms a connecting link between two bodies of standing water.Subsystem Unknown Perennial (5): This Subsystem designation was created specifically for use when the distinction between lower perennial, upper perennial, and tidal cannot be made from aerial photography and no data is available.Class Unconsolidated Bottom (UB): Includes all wetlands and deep-water habitats with at least 25% cover of particles smaller than stones (less than 6-7 cm), and a vegetative cover less than 30%.Water Regime Permanently Flooded (H): Water covers the substrate throughout the year in all years.There are three primary purposes for this notice. First, people who may be affected by activities in wetlands and those who have an interest in the protection of the natural environment should be given an opportunity to express their concerns and provide information about these areas. Second, an adequate public notice program can be an important public educational tool. The dissemination of information about wetlands can facilitate and enhance Federal efforts to reduce the risks associated with the occupancy and modification of these special areas. Third, as a matter of fairness, when the Federal government determines it will participate in actions taking place in wetlands, it must inform those who may be put at greater or continued risk.Written comments must be received by Industrial Development Board of Fentress County, Inc at the following address on or before 07/18/2024Industrial Development Board of Fentress County, IncP.O.

Pursuant to The Tennessee Water Quality Control Act of 1977, T.C.A. SS69-3-108 and Tennessee Rules, Chapter 0400-40-07, the proposed activity described below has been submitted for approval under an Aquatic Resource Alteration Permit and Section 401 Water Quality Certification. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires that an applicant obtain a water quality certification from the state when a federal permit is required. This notice is intended to inform interested parties of this permit application and draft permit and rationale, and to ask for comments and information necessary to determine possible impacts to water quality. At the conclusion of the public notice period a final determination will be made whether to issue or deny the permit. APPLICANTKristen Cecala735 University AvenueSewanee, Tennessee 37383302-354-2296 PROJECT DESCRIPTION / PURPOSEThe applicant proposes to divert up to 10% of the stream flow in four streams for one year. The flow is to be returned 50 meters downstream. The purpose of the work is for biological research.

PERMIT WRITER Robert D. BakerTennessee Department of Environment &ConservationDivision of WaterResources, NaturalResources UnitDavy Crockett Tower500 James Robertson Pkwy, 9th FloorNashville, Tennessee 37243615-532-0710robert.d.baker@tn.gov ANTIDEGRADATIONThe affected waters have available parameters for water withdrawal. The unnamed tributary to Little Fiery Gizzard Creek is an Exceptional Tennessee Water. As described in the accompanying permit rationale, the Department has made a preliminary determination that the proposed activity will result in de minimis degradation. FACTORS CONSIDEREDIn deciding whether to issue or deny this permit, the Division will consider all comments of record and the requirements of applicable federal and state laws. The division will consider the nature, scale and effects of proposed impacts. The Division will consider practicable alternatives to the alteration, loss of waters or habitat, diminishment in biological diversity, cumulative or secondary impacts to the water resource, and adverse impacts to unique, high quality, or impaired waters. In making this decision, a final determination will be made evaluating appreciable permanent loss of resource values and proposed compensatory mitigation to ensure the project will not result in no overall net loss of state water resources values. HOW TO COMMENTTDEC is requesting public comment on this proposed permit action. Obtaining a broad range of facts and opinions on Agency actions is one of the best ways to ensure appropriate decisions. Persons wishing to comment on the proposal are invited to submit written comments to the Division. Written comments must be received within thirty days following distribution of the approved public notice materials (including signage and newspaper ad). Comments will become part of the record and will be considered in the final decision. The applicant's name and permit number should be referenced.

P., A Minor, DOB: 11/10/2016 AGE: 07 Years SEX: Male SUMMONS AND PROCESS A Petition for Termination of Pa- rental Rights has been filed in this court concerning the above children. A copy of that Petition is attached to this summons. This is a summons requiring you to be in court. If you fail to come to court as required, you may be held in contempt of court and punished accordingly. Now therefore, you, the parties named above, are commanded to be and appear on the date and time stated below, and to remain in attendance from hour to hour, day to day, month to month, year to year, and time to time, as said case may be continued, and until discharged by the court, and you are commanded to lay any and all other business aside and to be and appear before the Juvenile Court of Lowndes County, Geor- gia , located at 120 Prison-Farm Rd, Valdosta, GA 31601 on Au- gust 20th, 2024 at 9:00 o'clock a.m. for the Motions hearing on the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights, and you the said parent, guardian or legal custodian are likewise hereby commanded to be and appear with the aforesaid children in said court at the time and place above stated, each of you then and there to make defense thereto and to show cause why said chil- dren and all parties named herein should not be dealt with accord- ing to the provisions of the law. If you fail to appear, the court can terminate your rights in your ab- sence. NOTICE OF EFFECT OF TERMINATION JUDGMENT Georgia law provides that you can permanently lose your rights as a parent. A petition to termi- nate parental rights has been filed requesting the court to termi- nate your parental rights to if you fail to appear, the court can termi- nate your rights in your absence. lf the court at the trial finds that the facts set out in the petition to terminate parental rights are true and that termination of your rights will serve the best interests of your children, the court can enter a judgment ending your rights to your children. If the judgment terminates your parental rights, you will no longer have any rights to your children. This means that you will not have the right to visit, contact, or have custody of your children or make any decisions affecting your chil- dren or your children's earnings or property. Your children will be legally freed to be adopted by someone else. Even if your parental rights are terminated: (1) You will still be responsible for providing financial support (chil- dren support payments) for your children's care unless and until your children is adopted; and (2) Your children can still inherit from you unless and until your children is adopted. This is a very serious matter. You should contact an attorney imme- diately so that you can be pre- pared for the court hearing. You have the right to hire an attorney and to have him or her represent you. If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, the court will ap- point an attorney if the court finds that you are an indigent person. Whether or not you decide to hire an attorney, you have the right to attend the hearing of your case, to call witnesses on your behalf, and to question those witnesses brought against you. If you have any questions con- cerning this notice, you may call the telephone number of the clerk's office which is 229-333- 5135. READ CAREFULLY Any party to this matter is entitled to representation by an attorney. If the Court determines that said party is unable, without undue financial hardship to provide pay- ment for an attorney and all other legal expenses for representa- tion, then such party becomes an \"indigent person\" and is en- titled to counsel as provided by O.C.G.A. SS 15-11-103. All parties who feel that they cannot afford an attorney are hereby required to personally contact the Lown- des County Juvenile Court, 327 N. Ashley St. 1st Floor, Valdosta, GA 31601, Monday through Fri- day between 9:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m. to determine whether they are entitled to the appoint- ment of an attorney. In the event any party to this matter fails to PERSONALLY contact said Lowndes County Juvenile Court prior to the date set for a hear- ing on this matter, said party will be deemed to have waived the right to appointed representation and the Court will proceed ac- cordingly. NO CONTINUANCES OF THIS MATTER SHALL BE GRANTED BY THE COURT FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING COUNSEL, except in those situ- ations where the interests of two or more parties conflict, and the same is determined by the Court.

Households receiving assistance under NJ SNAP or TANF should only submit an application if they are not notified of their eligibility by a specified date determined by the school. Households with children that are certified participants in SNAP or TANF may submit school meal applications for their children using the abbreviated information as indicated on the school meal application and instructions. WIC participants may also be eligible for free and reduced price meals. Parents/guardians should contact their child's school for more information. The school will advise parents of their child's eligibility within 10 working days of receipt of the application. Any parent dissatisfied with the eligibility determination may contact the school to request an informal conference or may appeal the decision by requesting a formal hearing. For up to 30 operating days into the new school year (or until a new eligibility determination is made, whichever comes first) an individual child who was determined as free or reduced price eligible during the previous year will continue with this determination. When children move to a new LEA, either at the beginning of the new school year or during the summer months, the new LEA is encouraged to use the former LEA's eligibility determination from the previous school year and carryover the child's eligibility status. Once determinations are completed, school officials are required to verify three percent of the approved free and reduced price applications on file. For additional information, contact your child's school.

Persons with disabilities who require alternative means of communication for program information (e.g. Braille, large print, audiotape, American Sign Language, etc.), should contact the Agency (State or local) where they applied for benefits. Individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech disabilities may contact USDA through the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339. Additionally, program information may be made available in languages other than English.

        "text": "Statement of Activities - 2024 USDA Housing Preservation Grant The Housing Authority of Southeastern Utah (HASU) is requesting a USDA-Rural Development Housing Preservation Grant in the amount of $47,000, for a rental property assistance program in Moab, Utah. This grant is proposed to fund updated kitchen cabinetry and countertops for one remaining unit, purchasing a propress plumbing tool that uses a proprietary copper crimp fitting for repairing aged water pipes, and installing upgraded electric stoves and refrigerators for all 28 existing Virginian Apartments units--all of which are owned and managed by HASU. Other than the monthly revenue each month the Virginian apartment units receive through unit rent prices, the Virginian apartments do not receive additional funding from any sources. The anticipated budget of $47,000 is solely for supply costs; personnel and additional administrative costs will be covered through existing salaries of individuals at HASU. A lump sum distribution is requested for the purchasing of equipment and supplies for countertop and cabinet installation, fridge, stoves, and propress plumbing tool. The Virginian Apartments, located at 71 E 300 S in Moab, Utah is a community development with the purpose of providing reasonably priced housing to very-low-, low-, and moderate-income family households. It consists of 14 one-bedroom and 14 two-bedroom units that were built under the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Rural Development (USDA-RD), 515 Rural Rental Housing Program in 1979. Of the 28 Virginian units, 22 households are of very-low, 3 are of low income brackets, and 3 are of moderate income brackets. There are 26 minority ethnicity individuals and 31 nonminority ethnicity individuals. The project is not located within a floodplain, wetland, or is correlated with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation--thus, no environmental review is required by USDA Rural Development. HASU does not need to contact the SHPO on behalf of the Virginian apartments because the development is less than 50 years old, and no unusual architectural features or artifacts have been found on or near the premises. The project will follow all development standards and guidelines associated with the Rural Development standards for existing dwellings, as well as IBC standards. The Housing Authority of Southeastern Utah employs the QuickBooks accounting system. HASU intends to provide the USDA-Rural Development with quarterly evaluations compliant with regulations prescribed by USDA RD 7 CFR 1944.683 and 7 CFR 1944.689. The property management staff is composed of a full-time manager and a readily on-call maintenance assistant. The maintenance assistant devotes one day of her work week to any maintenance fixes needed at the Virginian Apartments, though she has available flexibility to perform the described housing preservation work. HASU also has two additional full-time construction supervisors on staff who will be assisting with appliance replacements and cabinet and countertop upgrades. Annual inspections are performed by the property manager at each of the 28 Virginian apartment units, so all updates will be tracked and adequately monitored. The anticipated schedule of this project will begin in winter 2024. Outreach regarding the details of this project has been disseminated to local government staff and through the statement of activities posting in the Moab Times Independent. SLT0028471",

The property, located at 1805 South Main St., Salt Lake City, 84115, was originally a small motel before conversion to housing in the 1980s. The building has exceeded its useful life, in addition to being insufficient to meet the demand for housing. Alliance House is in the process of being approved for 16 project-based vouchers from the Salt Lake City Housing Authority. Once approved, those vouchers will provide a subsidy for all 16 units at 30% AMI. The proposed project will demolish the current building and construct a new 7481 sq ft project with 16 1 bedroom/ 1 bath deeply affordable rental homes on the 11,874 sq ft existing property, while providing up to 10 parking stalls. Each unit will be approx. 480 sq ft. The community will include 2 ADA units. The total estimated cost of the project is $6,695,607.00 that includes $312,796.00 of HOME funds from Salt Lake County. FINDING OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT Salt Lake County has determined that the project will have no significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Protection Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) is not required. Additional project information is contained in the Environmental Review Record (ERR) on file at Salt Lake County 2001 South State Street, S2-100, Salt Lake City, Utah 84114 and may be examined or copied weekdays 8 A.M to 5 P.M. and also available at Cowboy Partners office at 6440 South Wasatch Boulevard, Suite 100, Salt Lake City, UT 84121 weekdays between the hours of 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. PUBLIC COMMENTS Any individual, group, or agency may submit written comments on the ERR to the Salt Lake County, Housing and Community Development Office, 2001 South State Street S-2100, Salt Lake City, Utah 84114, or at jjimenez@slco.org. All comments received by August 3, 2024 will be considered by Salt Lake County prior to authorizing submission of a request for release of funds. Comments should specify which Notice they are addressing. ENVIRONMENTAL CERTIFICATION Salt Lake County certifies to HUD that Jennifer Wilson in her official capacity asSalt Lake County Mayor, consents to accept the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts if an action is brought to enforce responsibilities in relation to the environmental review process and that these responsibilities have been satisfied. HUD's approval of the certification satisfies its responsibilities under NEPA and related laws and authorities and allows Salt Lake County to use HUD funds. OBJECTIONS TO HUD RELEASE OF FUNDS HUD will accept objections to its release of funds and Salt Lake County's certification for a period of fifteen days following the anticipated submission date or its actual receipt of the request (whichever is later) only if they are on one of the following bases: (a) the certification was not executed by the Certifying Officer of HCD; (b) HCD has omitted a step or failed to make a decision or finding required by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations at 24 CFR Part 58; (c) the grant recipient or other participants in the development process have committed funds, incurred costs, or undertaken activities not authorized by 24 CFR Part 58 before approval of a release of funds by HUD; or (d) another Federal agency, acting pursuant to 40 CFR part 1504, has submitted a written finding that the project is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of environmental quality. Objections must be prepared and submitted via email in accordance with the required procedures (24 CFR Part 58, Sec. 58.76) and shall be addressed to Noemi Ghirghi, CPD Region VIII Director, at CPDRROFDEN@hud.gov.

DELL FOR PREMISES KNOWN AS LOT 2.01, Block 55 OF THE OFFICIAL TAX MAP OF THE BOROUGH OF MONMOUTH BEACH PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the Planning Board of the Borough of Monmouth Beach (the \"Board\") will hold a public hearing on Tuesday, July 23, 2024, at 7 pm at the Monmouth Beach Boro Hall, 22 Beach Road, Monmouth Beach, New Jersey to consider the application of Kevin J. Dell (\"Applicant\") for premises known as Lot 2.01, in Block 55 as shown on the Official Tax Map of the Borough of Monmouth Beach and located at 39 Valentine Street, Monmouth Beach, New Jersey. Applicant is seeking a side yard setback variance for a recently constructed elevated deck surrounding a recently constructed swimming pool. The lot contains an existing single-family dwelling, swimming pool, elevated deck, covered porch, stone driveway and other appurtenances. The property is located in the A-1 Zone of the Borough and the AE8 flood zone as per the FEMA flood maps. The property contains a lot area of 14,984 SF (0.34 AC). The construction of the pool and elevated deck was approved on June 10, 2021. Upon completion of the construction, it was determined that the elevated deck was constructed in a location which is not in compliance with Monmouth Beach side yard setback requirements and requires a variance. Per Section 30.8.22 of the applicable Ordinance, the minimum side yard setback requirement for the elevated deck is 10 feet. The corner of the elevated deck closest to Valentine Street is approximately 9.9 feet from the adjacent side yard property line and mistakenly continues for approximately 33 feet in a northeast direction and ending approximately 8.2 feet from the adjacent side yard property line. The engineering firm reviewing the application advised the Planning Board Secretary that the existing dwelling has a side yard setback of 7.5 feet. This is a pre-existing non-conformity, which is not being changed with the application. Applicant also expressly makes application for any additional exceptions, interpretations, waivers, variances, and other approvals as may be determined to be necessary by the Board or its professional advisors during the review and processing of the application, including with respect to the pre-existing non-conformity. PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that you are privileged to be present at said public hearing to present any and all comments you may have to the granting of said approvals. The hearing may be continued without further notice on such additional or other dates as the Board may determine. The application and supporting documents are on file with the Borough of Monmouth Beach, Planning Board, 18 Willow Avenue, Monmouth Beach, New Jersey and are available during the Borough's normal business hours. To review these materials, please contact the Board Secretary, Ms. Regina Hirsch, at 732-229-2204, ext. 1003. /s/ Kein J. Dell Kevin J.

If you fail to do so, judgment by default may be rendered against you for the relief demanded in the Complaint. You shall file your answer and proof of service in duplicate with the Clerk of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Hughes Justice Complex, 25 West Market Street, P.O. Box 971, Trenton, New Jersey 08625, in accordance with the Rules of Civil Practice and Procedure. This action has been instituted for the purpose of foreclosing tax sale certificate #14-00668 dated June 26, 2014, made by the Collector of Taxes for the City of Camden, County of Camden and State of New Jersey, and recorded in the office of the Camden County Clerk/Register in mortgage book 10066, page 250; and covers real estate located at 2014 S Broadway, City of Camden, County of Camden and State of New Jersey known as Block 500, Lot 8, as shown on the Tax Assessment Map and Tax Map duplicate of the City of Camden . NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS RELATING TO SURPLUS EQUITY (a) the within action could result in the loss of the property owners' equity in the property; (b) the potential loss of equity is a valid basis for contesting the tax foreclosure; and (c) the property owner has the ability to request a sheriff's sale of the property which would require any surplus beyond the amount owed to be deposited with the Superior Court Trust Fund.

        "text": "NOTICE TO ABSENT DEFENDANTS Docket No: F-4806-24 SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY, CAMDEN COUNTY STATE OF NEW JERSEY TO: DIRK DELEON PARKER; NORTH STAR CAPITAL ACQUISITIONS LLC You are hereby summoned and required to serve upon GARY C. ZEITZ, L.L.C., Plaintiff's Attorney, whose address is 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 170, Voorhees, New Jersey 08043, an answer to the Complaint (and any amendments thereto) filed in a civil action in which TLF 206 LLC is Plaintiff and Dirk Deleon Parker, et al. are Defendants pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Camden County and bearing Docket No. F-4806-24, within thirty-five (35) days after July 8, 2024, exclusive of such date. If you fail to do so, judgment by default may be rendered against you for the relief demanded in the Complaint. You shall file your answer and proof of service in duplicate with the Clerk of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Hughes Justice Complex, 25 West Market Street, P.O. Box 971, Trenton, New Jersey 08625, in accordance with the Rules of Civil Practice and Procedure. This action has been instituted for the purpose of foreclosing tax sale certificate #3-1678 dated February 6,2003, made by the Collector of Taxes for the City of Camden, County of Camden and State of New Jersey, and recorded in the office of the Camden County Clerk/Register in mortgage book 6334, page 472; and covers real estate located at 1245 Lansdown Ave, City of Camden, County of Camden and State of New Jersey known as Block 1331, Lot 116, as shown on the Tax Assessment Map and Tax Map duplicate of the City of Camden . NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS RELATING TO SURPLUS EQUITY (a) the within action could result in the loss of the property owners' equity in the property; (b) the potential loss of equity is a valid basis for contesting the tax foreclosure; and (c) the property owner has the ability to request a sheriff's sale of the property which would require any surplus beyond the amount owed to be deposited with the Superior Court Trust Fund. NOTICE OF SURPLUS EQUITY AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE: Pursuant to New Jersey Court Rule 4:64-1c (\"Definition of Uncontested Action\") any allegation in a responsive pleading to this complaint that a party has existing equity in the property shall be treated as a contesting answer to this tax foreclosure complaint. Pursuant to Tyler v. Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631, 143 S. Ct. 1369 (2023), a property owner may be entitled to the surplus which would be realized over and above the amount due to the plaintiff lienholder. According to Black's Law Dictionary 657 (10th ed. 2014), \"surplus\" is \"an amount of something that is more than what is required or used.\" If you believe there is a surplus beyond the amount owed to the plaintiff, you must assert same in a responsive pleading. The record owner of the lands and premises is/are DIRK DELEON PARKER and such owner(s) is/are named as proper party Defendant(s) to this action to foreclose his/her/their interest, and that of his/her/their successors, in the land and premises described in the Complaint. YOU, NORTH STAR CAPITAL ACQUISITIONS LLC are joined as a Defendant to this action by virtue of the following judgment: judgment number DJ-163095-2008 dated July 16, 2008 in the amount of $2,953.14 against Betty Cox.

In line with this, the Board of Commissioners intends to appoint two engineering firms for a two year contract, which is annually renewable. This RFQ is the first step in our search for these partners.

Additional project information is contained in the Environmental Review Record (ERR) on file at Douglas County's Senior Center at 6287 Fairburn Road, Douglasville, GA 30134.
